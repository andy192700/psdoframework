# Version 1.2.0
- Dofiles - the DoFramework's PowerShell make alternative
- Dotnet tool - call the framework from any terminal
- Streamlining of CLI function names

## New Features
Introducing [Dofiles](../Dofiles.md)! 
- The framework allows the creation of PowerShell projects which requires a caller to either be in the right directory or define the directory they are in using the `home` argument, this addition stops the need for that as project based calls can now be made from the location of a dofile.ps1 file (like a makefile).
- Dofiles are not limited to framework calls - they can be used for literally anything.
- Dofiles provide some advantages over make:
  - PowerShell syntax (no need to offload functionality to other scripts when additional horsepower is required).
  - PowerShell command line arguments (e.g. switches).
- Declare default variables and/or supply them via the CLI.
- Additional CLI functions added for ease of use.

[Dotnet tool](../DotnetTool.md) added to wrap calls to the framework so complicated and cumbersome PowerShell calls do not have to be constructed.

## Improvements
Streamlining of management [CLI function](../CLIFunctions.md) names - defunct "add/remove" in favour of "new/delete" which are more developer friendly.
